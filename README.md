## Tech

Wizzy uses a number of open source projects to work properly:

- [DiscordJs] - Discord Package
- [node.js] - evented I/O for the backend
- [Express] - fast node.js network app framework [@tjholowaychuk]

- [jQuery] - uh yeah duh

And of course Wizzy itself is open source with a [public repository][dill]
 on GitHub.

## Installation

Wizzy requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) v12+ to run.

```sh
cd twitch-follow-bot-discord
npm i
```

## Repl.it

Wizzy is very easy to install and deploy in a Repl.it project.

This will create the Wizzy repo and pull in the necessary dependencies.


Next Configure your discord token, and other details needed.
Next add twitch tokens.
Lastly, run
```sh
npm start
```
if that doesn't work, try using
```sh
node ./src/index.js
```
